# Formalization of a Branch-and-Bound algorithm

This work was done during an internship with Ren√© Thiemann in the university of Innsbruck in 2019.

In this repository, you can find the state of my work about a branch-and-bound algorithm at the end of my internship, in the file `Development.thy`. To run it, you should use Isabelle 2019 and the last release of *Archive for Formal Proofs* (AFP). Instructions to open this file with the Isabelle GUI are given in the head of the file.

Notice that you should not use this work as it is incomplete. Work needs to be done before any release, and it will be released in AFP. You should look at this at a snapshot of this work at a certain time.
